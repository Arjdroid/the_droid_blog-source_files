I am Arjun Singh, the maker/owner of this blog.
I like almost all things computer related, and I am a big fan of open-source technologies.
I also like other things like playing videogames, doing sports, eating good food, travelling, reading, taking photos and hanging out with friends!

Here are some of my favourite foods (all vegetarian, just like me!) -

* [Pizza](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Pizza)
* [Pasta](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Pasta) - [Spaghetti](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaghetti) & [Penne](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Penne)
* [Ramen](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramen) - with [Tofu](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Tofu)

Here are some of my favourite video games (or video game series) -
