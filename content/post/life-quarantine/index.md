What a bore, life has become, during these times of quarantine;

Whiling away the time, sitting at a desk, not a soul in site;

Although it is rather fortunate, for the few of us that prefer it;

Although most'd rather not be stuck at home, the alternative is most unpreferable, even to those who yearn to roam;

For the virus is spreading and killing at large, without a care for whom it smites, it strikes with no prejudice;

Thus, one mustn't leave the comfort of thy house;

For the virus is lurking, waiting to pounce;

A mask is a must, with shields bearing too;

For a single cough may sentence one to a tragic execution;

Hands must be washed, and faces not touched, for this savage beast, enters at opportunity, when given the chance;

All we can do to abolish the reign of this abominable fiend is to stay home, wear a mask, wash our hands and stay away from others;

The continuation of the society of humankind is dependent on scientists developing the vaccine so, may the odds be ever in their favour.

>> On a more serious note, please do follow the [W.H.O guidelines](https://www.who.int/health-topics/coronavirus) on the prevention of the spread of [COVID-19](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=covid-19), many, many lives depend on it.
