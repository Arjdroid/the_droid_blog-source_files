Many might argue that it's not really important to 'customise' your command line interface.
They may say that it's just a waste of time, not really important, or unnecessary.

Well, I think they're wrong.

When you spend a lot of your time working on a command line interface, it's pretty important (at least for me) to make sure that you like how your command line looks and that it is an efficient environment that can boost your productivity in your command line workflow.

A customised terminal is unique and brings the personality of the user into the console, highlighting what the user thinks is important. I also like things that are unique, one offs.
