Ah, lunch.

The finest meal of the day.

What would we do without it?

Fitting snuggly in the middle of the long gap between breakfast and dinner, ensuring one isn't famished.

Lunch, the meal that we enjoy basking in the brightest light of the day, the Sun blessing the Earth.

Lunch is the meal that brings people together, where guests visit for lunch before leaving to return home for dinner.

When one is done with a hearty lunch they feel drowsy and comfy, enjoying a quiet afternoon.

Lunch is also the break of relief from an ardruous school day or a pile of work at work.

Lunch is also a component of another fine mealtime, brunch, where one has just had breakfast but isn't ready for lunch yet is still hungry.

Lunch is where friends may be formed, bringing together strangers in a way that is not quite the same with dinner.

So tell me now, do you not believe as I do?

It is true, that lunch is the best meal of the day
