So, this project all started when my old faithful Windows PC started giving up so I had to temporarily work from my Macbook.
It was fine for the most part except that I didn't have access to most of the files on my 2 Terrabyte hard drive, that was a real problem because those files would've saved me a lot of time...

So, my father and I decided to setup a N.A.S!

Easy right? Not really...

There are a lot of options in terms of N.A.S storage devices, you could buy one of those pre-configured N.A.S boxes with their propreitary software and hardware which, if they break, you're out of luck, they're also often times really expensive!
So, what better alternative to closed sources and proprietary hardware than to use open source! 
Enter: Raspberry Pi; a tiny credit card sized fully functioning computer that is great for D.I.Y projects.
So it was decided that the Raspberry Pi4 would be the brains of the operation, N.A.S operation, at least at this small scale, isn't a really compute heavy process so we decreed that a 2GB Model of the Raspberry Pi4 would be sufficient for the task.
